# push

```markdown
Usage:  docker push [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG]

Push an image or a repository to a registry

Options:
  -a, --all-tags                Push all tagged images in the repository
      --disable-content-trust   Skip image signing (default true)
      --help                    Print usage
  -q, --quiet                   Suppress verbose output
```

## Description

Use `docker image push` to share your images to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)
registry or to a self-hosted one.

Refer to the [`docker image tag`](tag.md) reference for more information about valid
image and tag names.

Killing the `docker image push` process, for example by pressing `CTRL-c` while it is
running in a terminal, terminates the push operation.

Progress bars are shown during docker push, which show the uncompressed size.
The actual amount of data that's pushed will be compressed before sending, so
the uploaded size will not be reflected by the progress bar.

Registry credentials are managed by [docker login](login.md).

### Concurrent uploads

By default the Docker daemon will push five layers of an image at a time.
If you are on a low bandwidth connection this may cause timeout issues and you may want to lower
this via the `--max-concurrent-uploads` daemon option. See the
[daemon documentation](dockerd.md) for more details.

## Examples

### Push a new image to a registry

First save the new image by finding the container ID (using [`docker container ls`](ps.md))
and then committing it to a new image name.  Note that only `a-z0-9-_.` are
allowed when naming images:

```bash
$ docker container commit c16378f943fe rhel-httpd:latest
```

Now, push the image to the registry using the image ID. In this example the
registry is on host named `registry-host` and listening on port `5000`. To do
this, tag the image with the host name or IP address, and the port of the
registry:

```bash
$ docker image tag rhel-httpd:latest registry-host:5000/myadmin/rhel-httpd:latest

$ docker image push registry-host:5000/myadmin/rhel-httpd:latest
```

Check that this worked by running:

```bash
$ docker image ls
```

You should see both `rhel-httpd` and `registry-host:5000/myadmin/rhel-httpd`
listed.

### Push all tags of an image

Use the `-a` (or `--all-tags`) option to push To push all tags of a local image.

The following example creates multiple tags for an image, and pushes all those
tags to Docker Hub.


```bash
$ docker image tag myimage registry-host:5000/myname/myimage:latest
$ docker image tag myimage registry-host:5000/myname/myimage:v1.0.1
$ docker image tag myimage registry-host:5000/myname/myimage:v1.0
$ docker image tag myimage registry-host:5000/myname/myimage:v1
```

The image is now tagged under multiple names:

```bash
$ docker image ls

REPOSITORY                          TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED      SIZE
myimage                             latest     6d5fcfe5ff17   2 hours ago  1.22MB
registry-host:5000/myname/myimage   latest     6d5fcfe5ff17   2 hours ago  1.22MB
registry-host:5000/myname/myimage   v1         6d5fcfe5ff17   2 hours ago  1.22MB
registry-host:5000/myname/myimage   v1.0       6d5fcfe5ff17   2 hours ago  1.22MB
registry-host:5000/myname/myimage   v1.0.1     6d5fcfe5ff17   2 hours ago  1.22MB
```

When pushing with the `--all-tags` option, all tags of the `registry-host:5000/myname/myimage`
image are pushed:


```bash
$ docker image push --all-tags registry-host:5000/myname/myimage

The push refers to repository [registry-host:5000/myname/myimage]
