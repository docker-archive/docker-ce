```markdown
Usage:	docker system df [OPTIONS]

Show docker filesystem usage

Options:
      --format string   Pretty-print images using a Go template
      --help            Print usage
  -v, --verbose         Show detailed information on space usage
```

## Description

The `docker system df` command displays information regarding the
amount of disk space used by the docker daemon.

## Examples

By default the command will just show a summary of the data used:

```bash
$ docker system df

TYPE                TOTAL               ACTIVE              SIZE                RECLAIMABLE
Images              5                   2                   16.43 MB            11.63 MB (70%)
Containers          2                   0                   212 B               212 B (100%)
Local Volumes       2                   1                   36 B                0 B (0%)
```

A more detailed view can be requested using the `-v, --verbose` flag:

```bash
$ docker system df -v

```

* `SHARED SIZE` is the amount of space that an image shares with another one (i.e. their common data)
* `UNIQUE SIZE` is the amount of space that is only used by a given image
* `SIZE` is the virtual size of the image, it is the sum of `SHARED SIZE` and `UNIQUE SIZE`

> **Note**: Network information is not shown because it doesn't consume the disk

## Performance

The `system df` command can be very resource-intensive. It traverses the
filesystem of every image, container, and volume in the system. You should be
careful running this command in systems with lots of images, containers, or
volumes or in systems where some images, containers, or volumes have very large
filesystems with many files. You should also be careful not to run this command
in systems where performance is critical.

## Format the output

The formatting option (`--format`) pretty prints the disk usage output
using a Go template.

Valid placeholders for the Go template are listed below:

| Placeholder    | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `.Type`        | `Images`, `Containers` and `Local Volumes` |
| `.TotalCount`  | Total number of items                      |
| `.Active`      | Number of active items                     |
| `.Size`        | Available size                             |
| `.Reclaimable` | Reclaimable size                           |

When using the `--format` option, the `system df` command outputs
the data exactly as the template declares or, when using the
`table` directive, will include column headers as well.

The following example uses a template without headers and outputs the
`Type` and `TotalCount` entries separated by a colon:

```bash
$ docker system df --format "{{.Type}}: {{.TotalCount}}"

Images: 2
Containers: 4
Local Volumes: 1
```

To list the disk usage with size and reclaimable size in a table format you
can use:

```bash
$ docker system df --format "table {{.Type}}\t{{.Size}}\t{{.Reclaimable}}"

TYPE                SIZE                RECLAIMABLE
Images              2.547 GB            2.342 GB (91%)
Containers          0 B                 0 B
Local Volumes       150.3 MB            150.3 MB (100%)

```

**Note** the format option is meaningless when verbose is true.
