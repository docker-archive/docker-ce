## Description

The `docker build` command builds Docker images from a Dockerfile and a
"context". A build's context is the set of files located in the specified
`PATH` or `URL`. The build process can refer to any of the files in the
context. For example, your build can use a [*COPY*](../builder.md#copy)
instruction to reference a file in the context.

The `URL` parameter can refer to three kinds of resources: Git repositories,
pre-packaged tarball contexts and plain text files.

### Git repositories

When the `URL` parameter points to the location of a Git repository, the
repository acts as the build context. The system recursively fetches the
repository and its submodules. The commit history is not preserved. A
repository is first pulled into a temporary directory on your local host. After
the that succeeds, the directory is sent to the Docker daemon as the context.
Local copy gives you the ability to access private repositories using local
user credentials, VPN's, and so forth.

> **Note:**
> If the `URL` parameter contains a fragment the system will recursively clone
> the repository and its submodules using a `git clone --recursive` command.

Git URLs accept context configuration in their fragment section, separated by a
colon `:`.  The first part represents the reference that Git will check out,
and can be either a branch, a tag, or a remote reference. The second part
represents a subdirectory inside the repository that will be used as a build
context.

For example, run this command to use a directory called `docker` in the branch
`container`:

```bash
$ docker build https://github.com/docker/rootfs.git#container:docker
```

The following table represents all the valid suffixes with their build
contexts:

Build Syntax Suffix             | Commit Used           | Build Context Used
--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------
`myrepo.git`                    | `refs/heads/master`   | `/`
`myrepo.git#mytag`              | `refs/tags/mytag`     | `/`
`myrepo.git#mybranch`           | `refs/heads/mybranch` | `/`
`myrepo.git#pull/42/head`       | `refs/pull/42/head`   | `/`
`myrepo.git#:myfolder`          | `refs/heads/master`   | `/myfolder`
`myrepo.git#master:myfolder`    | `refs/heads/master`   | `/myfolder`
`myrepo.git#mytag:myfolder`     | `refs/tags/mytag`     | `/myfolder`
`myrepo.git#mybranch:myfolder`  | `refs/heads/mybranch` | `/myfolder`


### Tarball contexts

If you pass an URL to a remote tarball, the URL itself is sent to the daemon:

```bash
$ docker build http://server/context.tar.gz
```

The download operation will be performed on the host the Docker daemon is
running on, which is not necessarily the same host from which the build command
is being issued. The Docker daemon will fetch `context.tar.gz` and use it as the
build context. Tarball contexts must be tar archives conforming to the standard
`tar` UNIX format and can be compressed with any one of the 'xz', 'bzip2',
'gzip' or 'identity' (no compression) formats.

### Text files

Instead of specifying a context, you can pass a single `Dockerfile` in the
`URL` or pipe the file in via `STDIN`. To pipe a `Dockerfile` from `STDIN`:

```bash
$ docker build - < Dockerfile
```

With Powershell on Windows, you can run:

```powershell
Get-Content Dockerfile | docker build -
```

If you use `STDIN` or specify a `URL` pointing to a plain text file, the system
places the contents into a file called `Dockerfile`, and any `-f`, `--file`
option is ignored. In this scenario, there is no context.

By default the `docker build` command will look for a `Dockerfile` at the root
of the build context. The `-f`, `--file`, option lets you specify the path to
an alternative file to use instead. This is useful in cases where the same set
of files are used for multiple builds. The path must be to a file within the
build context. If a relative path is specified then it is interpreted as
relative to the root of the context.

In most cases, it's best to put each Dockerfile in an empty directory. Then,
add to that directory only the files needed for building the Dockerfile. To
increase the build's performance, you can exclude files and directories by
adding a `.dockerignore` file to that directory as well. For information on
creating one, see the [.dockerignore file](../builder.md#dockerignore-file).

If the Docker client loses connection to the daemon, the build is canceled.
This happens if you interrupt the Docker client with `CTRL-c` or if the Docker
client is killed for any reason. If the build initiated a pull which is still
running at the time the build is cancelled, the pull is cancelled as well.

## Return code

On a successful build, a return code of success `0` will be returned.  When the
build fails, a non-zero failure code will be returned.

There should be informational output of the reason for failure output to
`STDERR`:

```bash
$ docker build -t fail .

```

This example specifies that the `PATH` is `.`, and so all the files in the
local directory get `tar`d and sent to the Docker daemon. The `PATH` specifies
where to find the files for the "context" of the build on the Docker daemon.
Remember that the daemon could be running on a remote machine and that no
parsing of the Dockerfile happens at the client side (where you're running
`docker build`). That means that *all* the files at `PATH` get sent, not just
the ones listed to [*ADD*](../builder.md#add) in the Dockerfile.

The transfer of context from the local machine to the Docker daemon is what the
`docker` client means when you see the "Sending build context" message.

If you wish to keep the intermediate containers after the build is complete,
you must use `--rm=false`. This does not affect the build cache.

### Build with URL

```bash
$ docker build github.com/creack/docker-firefox
```

This will clone the GitHub repository and use the cloned repository as context.
The Dockerfile at the root of the repository is used as Dockerfile. You can
specify an arbitrary Git repository by using the `git://` or `git@` scheme.

```bash
$ docker build -f ctx/Dockerfile http://server/ctx.tar.gz

Downloading context: http://server/ctx.tar.gz [===================>]    240 B/240 B
Step 1/3 : FROM busybox

 ---> 3286931702ad
Removing intermediate container fbc63d321d73
Successfully built 377c409b35e4
```

This sends the URL `http://server/ctx.tar.gz` to the Docker daemon, which
downloads and extracts the referenced tarball. The `-f ctx/Dockerfile`
parameter specifies a path inside `ctx.tar.gz` to the `Dockerfile` that is used
to build the image. Any `ADD` commands in that `Dockerfile` that refers to local
paths must be relative to the root of the contents inside `ctx.tar.gz`. In the
example above, the tarball contains a directory `ctx/`, so the `ADD
ctx/container.cfg /` operation works as expected.

### Build with -

```bash
$ docker build - < Dockerfile
```

This will read a Dockerfile from `STDIN` without context. Due to the lack of a
context, no contents of any local directory will be sent to the Docker daemon.
Since there is no context, a Dockerfile `ADD` only works if it refers to a
remote URL.

```bash
$ docker build - < context.tar.gz
```

This will build an image for a compressed context read from `STDIN`.  Supported
formats are: bzip2, gzip and xz.

### Use a .dockerignore file

```bash
$ docker build .

Uploading context 18.829 MB
Uploading context

 ---> 769b9341d937
Step 2/2 : CMD echo Hello world

 ---> 769b9341d937
Step 2/2 : CMD echo Hello world
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 99cc1ad10469

```

This example shows the use of the `.dockerignore` file to exclude the `.git`
directory from the context. Its effect can be seen in the changed size of the
uploaded context. The builder reference contains detailed information on
[creating a .dockerignore file](../builder.md#dockerignore-file)

### Tag an image (-t)

```bash
$ docker build -t vieux/apache:2.0 .
```

This will build like the previous example, but it will then tag the resulting
image. The repository name will be `vieux/apache` and the tag will be `2.0`.
[Read more about valid tags](tag.md).

You can apply multiple tags to an image. For example, you can apply the `latest`
tag to a newly built image and add another tag that references a specific
version.
For example, to tag an image both as `whenry/fedora-jboss:latest` and
`whenry/fedora-jboss:v2.1`, use the following:

```bash
$ docker build -t whenry/fedora-jboss:latest -t whenry/fedora-jboss:v2.1 .
```

### Specify a Dockerfile (-f)

```bash
$ docker build -f Dockerfile.debug .
```

This will use a file called `Dockerfile.debug` for the build instructions
instead of `Dockerfile`.

```bash
$ curl example.com/remote/Dockerfile | docker build -f - .
```

The above command will use the current directory as the build context and read
a Dockerfile from stdin.

```bash
$ docker build -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile.debug -t myapp_debug .
$ docker build -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile.prod  -t myapp_prod .
```

The above commands will build the current build context (as specified by the
`.`) twice, once using a debug version of a `Dockerfile` and once using a
production version.

```bash
$ cd /home/me/myapp/some/dir/really/deep
$ docker build -f /home/me/myapp/dockerfiles/debug /home/me/myapp
$ docker build -f ../../../../dockerfiles/debug /home/me/myapp
```

These two `docker build` commands do the exact same thing. They both use the
contents of the `debug` file instead of looking for a `Dockerfile` and will use
`/home/me/myapp` as the root of the build context. Note that `debug` is in the
directory structure of the build context, regardless of how you refer to it on
the command line.

> **Note:**
> `docker build` will return a `no such file or directory` error if the
> file or directory does not exist in the uploaded context. This may

> elsewhere on the Host system. The context is limited to the current

### Use a custom parent cgroup (--cgroup-parent)

When `docker build` is run with the `--cgroup-parent` option the containers
used in the build will be run with the [corresponding `docker run`
flag](../run.md#specifying-custom-cgroups).

### Set ulimits in container (--ulimit)

Using the `--ulimit` option with `docker build` will cause each build step's
container to be started using those [`--ulimit`
flag values](./run.md#set-ulimits-in-container-ulimit).

### Set build-time variables (--build-arg)

You can use `ENV` instructions in a Dockerfile to define variable
values. These values persist in the built image. However, often
persistence is not what you want. Users want to specify variables differently
depending on which host they build an image on.

A good example is `http_proxy` or source versions for pulling intermediate
files. The `ARG` instruction lets Dockerfile authors define values that users
can set at build-time using the  `--build-arg` flag:

```bash
$ docker build --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=http://10.20.30.2:1234 .
```

This flag allows you to pass the build-time variables that are
accessed like regular environment variables in the `RUN` instruction of the
Dockerfile. Also, these values don't persist in the intermediate or final images
like `ENV` values do.

Using this flag will not alter the output you see when the `ARG` lines from the
Dockerfile are echoed during the build process.

For detailed information on using `ARG` and `ENV` instructions, see the
[Dockerfile reference](../builder.md).

### Optional security options (--security-opt)

This flag is only supported on a daemon running on Windows, and only supports
the `credentialspec` option. The `credentialspec` must be in the format
`file://spec.txt` or `registry://keyname`.

### Specify isolation technology for container (--isolation)

This option is useful in situations where you are running Docker containers on
Windows. The `--isolation=<value>` option sets a container's isolation
technology. On Linux, the only supported is the `default` option which uses
Linux namespaces. On Microsoft Windows, you can specify these values:


| Value     | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default` | Use the value specified by the Docker daemon's `--exec-opt` . If the `daemon` does not specify an isolation technology, Microsoft Windows uses `process` as its default value.  |
| `process` | Namespace isolation only.                                                                                                                                     |
| `hyperv`  | Hyper-V hypervisor partition-based isolation.                                                                                                                 |

Specifying the `--isolation` flag without a value is the same as setting `--isolation="default"`.

### Add entries to container hosts file (--add-host)

You can add other hosts into a container's `/etc/hosts` file by using one or
more `--add-host` flags. This example adds a static address for a host named
`docker`:

    $ docker build --add-host=docker:10.180.0.1 .

### Specifying target build stage (--target)

When building a Dockerfile with multiple build stages, `--target` can be used to
specify an intermediate build stage by name as a final stage for the resulting
image. Commands after the target stage will be skipped.

```Dockerfile
FROM debian AS build-env
...

FROM alpine AS production-env
...
```

```bash
$ docker build -t mybuildimage --target build-env .
```

### Squash an image's layers (--squash) **Experimental Only**

#### Overview

Once the image is built, squash the new layers into a new image with a single
new layer. Squashing does not destroy any existing image, rather it creates a new
image with the content of the squashed layers. This effectively makes it look
like all `Dockerfile` commands were created with a single layer. The build
cache is preserved with this method.

**Note**: using this option means the new image will not be able to take
advantage of layer sharing with other images and may use significantly more
space.

**Note**: using this option you may see significantly more space used due to
storing two copies of the image, one for the build cache with all the cache
layers in tact, and one for the squashed version.

#### Prerequisites

The example on this page is using experimental mode in Docker 1.13.

Experimental mode can be enabled by using the `--experimental` flag when starting the Docker daemon or setting `experimental: true` in the `daemon.json` configuration file.

By default, experimental mode is disabled. To see the current configuration, use the `docker version` command.

```none

Server:
 Version:      1.13.1
 API version:  1.26 (minimum version 1.12)
 Go version:   go1.7.5
 Git commit:   092cba3
 Built:        Wed Feb  8 06:35:24 2017
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
 Experimental: false

 [...]

```

To enable experimental mode, users need to restart the docker daemon with the experimental flag enabled.

#### Enable Docker experimental

Experimental features are now included in the standard Docker binaries as of version 1.13.0. For enabling experimental features, you need to start the Docker daemon with `--experimental` flag. You can also enable the daemon flag via /etc/docker/daemon.json. e.g.

```

{
    "experimental": true
}

```
Then make sure the experimental flag is enabled:

```bash

$ docker version -f '{{.Server.Experimental}}'
true

```

#### Build an image with `--squash` argument

The following is an example of docker build with `--squash` argument

```Dockerfile

FROM busybox
RUN echo hello > /hello
RUN echo world >> /hello
RUN touch remove_me /remove_me
ENV HELLO world
RUN rm /remove_me

```
An image named `test` is built with `--squash` argument.

```bash

$ docker build --squash -t test .

[...]

```

If everything is right, the history will look like this:

```bash
$ docker history test
