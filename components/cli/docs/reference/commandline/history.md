## Examples

To see how the `docker:latest` image was built:

```bash
$ docker history docker

IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE                COMMENT

To see how the `docker:apache` image was added to a container's base image:

```bash
$ docker history docker:scm
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE                COMMENT

### Format the output

The formatting option (`--format`) will pretty-prints history output
using a Go template.

Valid placeholders for the Go template are listed below:

| Placeholder     | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `.ID`           | Image ID    |
| `.CreatedSince` | Elapsed time since the image was created if `--human=true`, otherwise timestamp of when image was created |
| `.CreatedAt`    | Timestamp of when image was created |
| `.CreatedBy`    | Command that was used to create the image |
| `.Size`         | Image disk size |
| `.Comment`      | Comment for image |

When using the `--format` option, the `history` command will either
output the data exactly as the template declares or, when using the
`table` directive, will include column headers as well.

The following example uses a template without headers and outputs the
`ID` and `CreatedSince` entries separated by a colon for all images:

```bash
$ docker images --format "{{.ID}}: {{.Created}} ago"
