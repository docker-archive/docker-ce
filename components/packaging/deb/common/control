Description: Docker: the open-source application container engine
 Docker is a product for you to build, ship and run any application as a
 lightweight container
 .
 Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means
 they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest cloud compute instance and
 everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular
 language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks
 for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without
 depending on a particular stack or provider.

# slirp4netns (>= 0.4.0) is available in Debian since 11 and Ubuntu since 19.10
Recommends: slirp4netns (>= 0.4.0)
# Unlike RPM, DEB packages do not contain "Recommends: fuse-overlayfs (>= 0.7.0)" here,
# because Debian (since 10) and Ubuntu support the kernel-mode rootless overlayfs.
Description: Rootless support for Docker.
  Use dockerd-rootless.sh to run the daemon.
  Use dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh to setup systemd for dockerd-rootless.sh .
  This package contains RootlessKit, but does not contain VPNKit.
  Either VPNKit or slirp4netns (>= 0.4.0) needs to be installed separately.
