# Docker CE

This repository hosts open source components of Docker CE products. The
`master` branch serves to unify the upstream components on a regular
basis. Long-lived release branches host the code that goes into a product
version for the lifetime of the product.

This repository is solely maintained by Docker, Inc.

Rules for contributing can be found here: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Issues

There are separate issue-tracking repos for the end user Docker CE
products specialized for a platform. Find your issue or file a new issue
for the platform you are using:

* https://github.com/docker/for-linux
* https://github.com/docker/for-mac
* https://github.com/docker/for-win
* https://github.com/docker/for-aws
* https://github.com/docker/for-azure

## Unifying upstream sources

The `master` branch is a combination of components adapted from
different upstream git repos into a unified directory structure using the
[moby-components](https://github.com/shykes/moby-extras/blob/master/cmd/moby-components)
tool.

You can view the upstream git repos in the
[components.conf](components.conf) file. Each component is isolated into
its own directory under the [components](components) directory.

The tool will import each component git history within the appropriate path.

For example, this shows a commit
is imported into the component `engine` from
[moby/moby@a27b4b8](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/a27b4b8cb8e838d03a99b6d2b30f76bdaf2f9e5d)
into the `components/engine` directory.

## Updates to `master` branch

Main development of new features should be directed towards the upstream
git repos. The `master` branch of this repo will periodically pull in new
changes from upstream to provide a point for integration.

## Branching for release

When a release is started for Docker CE, a new branch will be created
from `master`. Branch names will be `YY.MM` to represent the time-based
release version of the product, e.g. `17.06`.

## Adding fixes to release branch

Note: every commit of a fix should affect files only within one component
directory.

### Fix available upstream

A PR cherry-picking the necessary commits should be created against
the release branch. If the the cherry-pick cannot be applied cleanly,
the logic of the fix should be ported manually.

### No fix yet

First create the PR with the fix for the release branch. Once the fix has
been merged, be sure to port the fix to the respective upstream git repo.

## Release tags

There will be a git tag for each release candidate (RC) and general
availablilty (GA) release. The tag will only point to commits on release
branches.
